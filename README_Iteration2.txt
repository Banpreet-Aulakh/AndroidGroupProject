For next iteration: 
	currently the listview we used for entering player scores is practically limited to 4 players, as 
	listview is a deprecated feature that is meant to be used with static lists. When scrolling in listview,
	get view will occasionally randomly populate score elements when it is not supposed to. We plan to make this
	feature use another object to enter player scores in the next iteration, likely recyclerview. 
	
we only put background images on screens where readability is not affected so as to not interfere with overall usability
