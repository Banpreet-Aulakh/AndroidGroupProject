# CMPT 276: Introduction to Software Engineering Group Project

## Group Work 
For this project I worked with 3 other individuals to create an Android App based on requirements from a client (the prof). These requirements
were obtained in the form of deliverables split into 3 iterations. The role of each group member was defined based on Scrum development where we had
4 roles that we rotated every iteration:
- Scrum Master
- Product Owner
- Repo Manager
- Group Member

These roles helped the group gain experience in key software engineering practices such as:
- Agile Development and Scrum
- Requirements Engineering

We did very well on the project with a grade of 99.91/100. 

## The App
The idea of our client is to create an app that can add co-operative point goals to competitive board games. For example, if you were playing monopoly then
the money each player had by the end could be converted to points to meet some arbitrary score and earn an achievement. This is precisely what our app does.

The app integrates features using:
- Shared Preferences to store data
- Model-View Separation for logic and UI
- Complex List Adapters to enable icons and images and better layout of scores
- Camera access to take pictures of the game to replace icons OR take group photos to commemorate a game.
